# Merge sort

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
* Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted);
* Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

## Complexity

**Time complexity**: `O(n*log(n))`.
