# Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Complexity

**Time complexity**: `n^2` - since in worst case the algorithm iterates `n` times, and each step compares/swaps `n` elements.
