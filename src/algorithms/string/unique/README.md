# Is Unique

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## uniqueV1

This algorithm uses additional memory which gives you `O(n)` time and `O(n)` memory.

## uniqueV2

This algorithm does not use additional memory but alters the input. This one gives you `O(n * log n)` time (depends on the sorting algorithm you choose).
