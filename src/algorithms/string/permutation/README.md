# Check Permutation

Given two st4rings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

## permutationV1

This algorithm uses additional memory which gives you `O(n)` time and `O(n)` memory.

## permutationV2

This algorithm does not use additional memory but alters the input. This one gives you `O(n * log n)` time (depends on the sorting algorithm you choose).
