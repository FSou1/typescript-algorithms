# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

* Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).
