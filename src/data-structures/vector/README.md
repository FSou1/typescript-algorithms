# Vector

A vector, in computing, is generally a one-dimensional array, typically storing numbers. Vectors typically have fixed sizes, unlike lists and queues.

The vector data structure can be used to represent the mathematical vector used in linear algebra. See related pages for mathematical vector operations. Vectors are often used in computing in computer graphics and simulating physical systems.
